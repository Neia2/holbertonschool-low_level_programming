0x14. C - Bit manipulation Tasks Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1 Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
10 Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index); where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured
11 Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
100 Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
10 Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
